Exercise 1: Initializing a Git Repository
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your desired project directory.
2. Use the `git init` command to create a new Git repository in that directory.
3. Verify that the repository has been created successfully. Use the `git status` command to check the status of your repository.
4. How do you know it has initialized sucessfully?

Exercise 2: Tracking Changes
1. Create a new text file (e.g., "example.txt") in your repository.
2. Use `git status` to see the status of your repository. What does it show?
3. Use `git add` to stage the "example.txt" file for a commit.
4. Check the status again using `git status`. What's the difference now?

Exercise 3: Making a Commit
1. Use `git commit` to create a commit with the staged changes. Don't forget to provide a meaningful commit message.
2. Use `git status` to check the status of your repository once more. What does it show now?

Exercise 4: Viewing Commit History
1. Use `git log` to view the commit history of your repository. This will display a list of commits, including the commit message, author, date, and a unique commit hash.
2. Try adding the `--oneline` option to `git log` to display a more concise version of the commit history.

Exercise 5: Making More Changes
1. Make additional changes to the "example.txt" file.
2. Use `git status` to see the status of your repository. Are the changes detected?
3. Use `git add` to stage the new changes.
4. Create a new commit with the staged changes using `git commit`.

Exercise 6: Reviewing Commit History
1. Use `git log` to view the updated commit history. You should now see the new commits you made.
